# CSS tricks
If you add ?calendarID=NAME at the end of the URL of your *.ics calendar you can use this NAME in a css selector to colour each *.ics calendar differently
```shell
[event_id^="christian"],[event_id^="christian"] div {background-color: #FF0000 !important;color: #FFFFFF !important;}
```

## Docker -u 1000:1000 (no root initiative)
As part to make containers more secure, this container will not run as root, but as uid:gid 1000:1000. Therefore the default TCP port is 5000.
