## Nginx reverse proxy
In order to use this container you should run it behind an nginx reverse proxy, here is a simple demo configuration that makes it possible to use the URL https://domain.com/myconfig.cal (you can use the name of the json file without .json replaced by .cal, default.cal, myconfig.cal, ...)
```shell
location / {
        proxy_pass http://IP:8080$request_uri;
}

location ~* /(.+)\.cal$ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/?config=http://localhost:8080/etc/$1.json
}
```

## Docker -u 1000:1000 (no root initiative)
As part to make containers more secure, this container will not run as root, but as uid:gid 1000:1000. Therefore the default TCP port is 8080.
